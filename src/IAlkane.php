     The oxidation of alkanes by O2 to give carbon dioxide and water is by far their most economically important reaction. Oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons is the basis for their use as energy sources for heat [natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and fuel oil] and power (gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel). Following are balanced equations for the complete oxidation of methane (the major component of natural gas) and propane (the major component of LPG).
